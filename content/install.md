# Install the Wazo Platform UC use case

To install the Unified Communication use case in an all-in-one
setup, do the following steps:

1. Install a Debian 10 Buster system
2. Run the following commands as root on the Debian system to
   provision sudo, git and Ansible:

```ShellSession
# apt-get install -yq sudo git ansible
```

4. Extract the Wazo Platform installer

```ShellSession
# git clone https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-ansible.git
# cd wazo-ansible
# ansible-galaxy install -r requirements-postgresql.yml
```

5. Edit the Ansible inventory in `inventories/uc-engine` to add your
   preferences and passwords. The various variables that can be
   customized are described at
   <https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-ansible/blob/master/README.md#variables>.

If you want to install the web user interface, activate the following
in your inventory:

```Ini
[uc-ui:children]
uc-engine-host
```

To create the `root` account at installation time and be able to use the web user interface
and REST APIs, you need to add the following variables:

```Ini
[uc-engine:vars]
engine_api_configure_wizard = true
engine_api_root_password = ****
```

6. Launch the installation by running the following command:

```ShellSession
# ansible-playbook -i inventories/uc-engine uc-engine.yml
```

# Use the REST API

You may now use the REST API from outside your system (here `wazo.example.com`).

1. Get an authentication token for 1 hour:

Using the `api_client_name` and `api_client_password` you defined in
your inventory, you can execute from the Debian system:

```ShellSession
$ wazo-auth-cli token create --auth-user <api_client_name> --auth-password <api_client_password>
```
Or with curl from anywhere:

```ShellSession
$ curl -k -X POST -u <api_client_name>:<api_client_password> -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"expiration": "3600"}' https://wazo.example.com/api/auth/0.1/token
```

2. Use any REST API you want, for example, to list the telephony users configured on the system:

Note: You should replace the following values:
* `my-token` with the authentication token

```ShellSession
$ curl -k -X GET -H 'X-Auth-Token: <my-token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"firstname": "user1"}' https://wazo.example.com/api/confd/1.1/users
```

Note: the token that you have now only has permissions for configuration REST API (wazo-confd).
